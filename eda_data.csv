(Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money.

In the 1840s, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace worked on an early version of the computer known as the “Analytics Engine”. In the words of computing historian Doron Swade, “What Lovelace saw...was that numbers could represent entities other than quantity” and together they laid the foundation for general-purpose computing.

The MindScope program seeks to understand the transformations, sometimes called computations, in coding and decoding that lead from photons to behavior and conscious experience by observing, perturbing, and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the cortical-thalamic visual system within a few perception-action cycles.
We are seeking a Scientist to be an essential member of a team investigating cell type-specific function by integrating in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging with in vitro spatial transcriptomics. The role of this Scientist will be to perform data analysis and modeling of optical physiology data to study neural coding and circuit dynamics.

The first Data Scientist at Finrise will play an imperative role in enabling patient financing for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. You recognize that 56% of Americans with a less than ideal FICO Score need new ways to evaluate creditworthiness in efficient and holistic ways. You’re excited about tackling technical problems that most wouldn’t dare touch. Working with unstructured and nontraditional data doesn’t scare you. Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

Data-driven driver model. Future vehicle speed prediction, using as input route information from navigation system, and prior driving history. Applications include EV range prediction, horizon generation for driving/powertrain control optimization, eco-routing, drive cycle generation, etc. The candidate will train the model on very large databases of real-world driving data, and special attention will be paid to demonstrating the validity of the model.
AI for “eco” automated driving controls. Applying AI to longitudinal speed control with energy-efficiency as one of the objectives. The input to the AI will be information from sensors, V2V communications and digital maps. Training will involve running very-large scale simulations of automated driving vehicles using HPC. After demonstration of robustness and performance in simulation, the newly developed controls will then be deployed and demonstrated in experimental automated vehicles.

Guillermo (Gary) J. Tearney, M.D., Ph.D.
Tearney Lab – Wellman Center for Photomedicine
Massachusetts General Hospital

The Tearney Lab is an 80+ person multidisciplinary lab led by Guillermo (Gary) Tearney, MD, PhD. The goal of the Tearney Lab is to see every cell in the human body so that disease can be detected at its earliest stages when it can be cured.

To this end, the lab has pioneered multiple optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices that enable 3D imaging at the microscopic scale in living human patients. These technologies include multimodality OCT where OCT is combined with spectroscopy, fluorescence, and other optical techniques, ultrahigh-resolution OCT (µOCT) where the resolution is sufficiently detailed to visualize individual cells, and functional OCT that measures the function and metabolism of cells in living systems. These technologies are implemented in a variety of devices (endoscopes, catheters, capsules, implantable) that provide accessible imaging anywhere inside the body. The lab has major programs to overcome clinical diagnostic challenges in celiac disease, food allergy disorders, malnutrition, coronary artery disease, hearing loss, GI cancer, and cystic fibrosis, among others. Novel technologies are created using device development processes and tested and validated in over 15 ongoing single- and multi-center clinical studies.

To enable this broad translational research, the Tearney Lab is outfitted with:


The role will


A masters or Ph.D. (desired) in Computer Science or Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics, or a related field is required.


A strong background in machine learning
Experience on deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras or TensorFlow
Experience with OCT image analysis and OCT machine learning
A strong understanding of classical image processing techniques using MATLAB, ImageJ, and Python. Techniques include spatial frequency domain filtering, lumen segmentation, and denoising data.


Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP), embedded operating systems, Arduino, and GPU programming are helpful
An understanding of types of different types of in-vivo medical imaging systems such as fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy, ultrasound, photoacoustics
An understanding of histological processing methods and identification of normal and abnormal tissue in several disease types
An understanding of tissue optical properties


Interested candidates are encouraged to send a CV accompanied by a cover letter describing any previous research training, specific areas of interest, and contact information for three letters of reference.
